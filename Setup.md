# Homebrew

You need a package manager. Us Mac users have Homebrew for this but you have to install it. 

Pull up your terminal:

\<command\> + \<space bar\> to bring up Spotlight Search and type in:

```
terminal.app  
```

then copy/paste this command:
  
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
