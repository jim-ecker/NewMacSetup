# Homebrew

You need a package manager.

Pull up your terminal:

\<command\> + \<space bar\> to bring up Spotlight Search and type in:

```
terminal.app  
```

then copy/paste this command:
  
```zsh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Homebrew will tell you to use these commands to add it to your PATH but it's easy to miss so here they are

```zsh
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> $HOME/.zprofile

eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

# iTerm

Install iTerm using Homebrew

```zsh
brew install --cask iterm2
```

At first its going to be boring like this

![New Install of iTerm](https://github.com/jim-ecker/NewMacSetup/blob/main/images/iterm_new.png "New Install of iTerm")

Let's make it look better

## Oh-My-ZSH

Install Oh My ZSH

```zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

When it's done you'll see something like this

![New Install of Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/jim-ecker/NewMacSetup/blob/main/images/ohmyzsh_install.png "New Install of Oh My ZSH")

### Oh My ZSH Plugins ###

Now we want to install some plugins

#### [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) ####

1. Clone this repository into `$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins` (by default `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins`)

    ```zsh
    git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
    ```

2. Add the plugin to the list of plugins for Oh My Zsh to load (inside `~/.zshrc`):

    ```zsh
    plugins=( 
        # other plugins...
        zsh-autosuggestions
    )
    ```

3. Start a new terminal session.

#### [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) ####

1. Install via Homebrew

```zsh
brew install zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

2. To activate the syntax highlighting, add the following at the end of your `.zshrc`:

```zsh
  source /opt/homebrew/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
```

#### [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) ####

Install Powerlevel10k to customize the command line bar

```zsh
brew install powerlevel10k
echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme" >>~/.zshrc
```
Restart your terminal. Once you do Powerlevel10k's installation wizard will start. Step through it to set up your customization

![Powerlevel10k Init](https://github.com/jim-ecker/NewMacSetup/blob/main/images/powerlevel10k_init.png "Powerlevel10k Init")

Once you're done you'll have a cool looking cli bar like this:

![Powerlevel10k bar](https://github.com/jim-ecker/NewMacSetup/blob/main/images/init_done.png "Powerlevel10k Bar")

## iTerm Preferences

1. Use Ligatures

**iTerm > Settings > Profiles >** ***Text***

checkmark *Use ligatures*

2. Color Scheme

**iTerm > Settings > Profiles >** ***Colors***

Click the *Color Presets...* dropdown and select *Solarized Dark*

3. Transparency

**iTerm > Settings > Profiles >** ***Window***

Set *Transparency* to 5

# Apps

## [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza)

---

**eza** is a modern, maintained replacement for the venerable file-listing command-line program `ls` that ships with Unix and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and better defaults.
It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata.
It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git.
And it‚Äôs **small**, **fast**, and just **one single binary**.

By deliberately making some decisions differently, eza attempts to be a more featureful, more user-friendly version of `ls`.

---
```zsh
brew install eza
```

Then alias ls to point to exa now. Add this to your `.zshrc` file:

```zsh
alias ls="eza --icons -lh"
```

add an alias to print the directory map as a tree with icons

```zsh
alias tree="eza --icons --tree"
```

## [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)

---

A *cat(1)* clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration.

*bat* allows you to *cat(1)* files with syntax highlighting and line numbering, which makes reading code on cli on the fly much easier

---

```zsh
brew install bat
```

I like to alias bat so that I can envoke it using "cat"

```zsh
alias cat="bat"
```

## [Midnight Commander](https://github.com/MidnightCommander/mc)

---

**Midnight Commander** allows you to manage files while making the most of
your screen and giving you a clear representation of the filesystem, yet
it's simple enough to be run over a telnet or ssh session.

---

```zsh
brew install midnight-commander
```

## ‚úÖ Terminal: Ghostty

Ghostty is a GPU-accelerated terminal emulator that supports:

- Truecolor and transparency
- Inline images (Kitty protocol, iTerm2)
- Fast font rendering
- Configurable keybindings

---

## üìÇ Config Location

Ghostty looks for config files in:

- macOS:
  ```
  ~/Library/Application Support/ghostty/config
  ```
- Unix (alternative):
  ```
  ~/.config/ghostty/config
  ```

---

## üé® Sample `config` File

```ini
font-family = MesloLGS Nerd Font Mono
font-size = 19
background-opacity = 0.9
theme = Argonaut

# Fix HOME and END keys
key home = "\x1b[H"
key end  = "\x1b[F"
```

---

## ‚å®Ô∏è Notes on Key Bindings

- You must **save the file with proper permissions**.
- If `E212: Can't open file for writing` occurs in Vim:
  - You likely opened the wrong path or lacked write permission.
  - Use `~/.config/ghostty/config` if `Library/...` is read-only.

---

## üîß Home / End Key Fix

By default, `Home` and `End` may not behave correctly in Zsh/Vim. The fix:

```ini
key home = "\x1b[H"
key end  = "\x1b[F"
```

You can test key behavior with:

```bash
bindkey | grep '\[H'
```

And test `run-help` functionality in Zsh by typing a command and pressing `Alt+h`.

---

## üß™ Inline Image Tools (Kitty / iTerm2)

- `chafa`: terminal-based image viewer using ANSI art
- `viu`: displays inline images with truecolor
- `icat kitten`: supports inline images via Kitty protocol

Ghostty supports **Kitty image protocol**, but may render images as overlays instead of inline text.

To resize to terminal:

```bash
chafa --symbols=block --colors=16 --size=$(tput cols)x$(tput lines) image.jpg
```

To avoid color when testing:

```bash
chafa --symbols=ascii --dither=none --colors=2 image.jpg
```

Note: `--colors=2` may still render color if terminal supports it and `color-space` isn't restricted.

---

## üî§ Font Recommendation

- **MesloLGS Nerd Font Mono**  
  (Perfect for Powerlevel10k, has full icon support.)

Install via:

```bash
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-meslo-lg-nerd-font
```

---

# Modern Neovim Configuration (Ghostty + Powerlevel10k + Nerd Font)

This is a complete, modern Neovim setup tailored for:

- GPU-accelerated terminal: **Ghostty**
- Nerd Font icon support
- Powerlevel10k prompt
- Lua-based plugin configuration via **Lazy.nvim**
- Gruvbox theme, Telescope, Tree-sitter, LSP, and file explorer

---

## Features Included

- [x] Lazy.nvim plugin manager
- [x] Gruvbox color theme with truecolor
- [x] Telescope fuzzy finder (`<leader>ff`, `<leader>fg`, etc.)
- [x] Treesitter syntax highlighting
- [x] Built-in LSP with Mason (Lua, Bash, Python)
- [x] Auto-completion with `nvim-cmp`
- [x] Statusline with `lualine.nvim`
- [x] Git status via `gitsigns.nvim`
- [x] Nerd Font + Web Dev Icons
- [x] Modern file explorer with `nvim-tree.lua` (`<leader>e`)

---

## File Structure

Your config lives in:

```
~/.config/nvim/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init.lua
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lua/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ core/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ options.lua
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ keymaps.lua
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugins.lua
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lsp.lua
```

---

## Key Bindings

| Key Combo      | Action               |
|----------------|----------------------|
| `<leader>ff`   | Find files           |
| `<leader>fg`   | Live grep            |
| `<leader>fb`   | List buffers         |
| `<leader>fh`   | Help tags            |
| `<leader>e`    | Toggle file explorer |

(`leader` is set to **space**)

---

## Setup Notes

- **Leader key** is set at the top of your config:
  ```lua
  vim.g.mapleader = " "
  ```
- **netrw is disabled** to avoid conflict with `nvim-tree`:
  ```lua
  vim.g.loaded_netrw = 1
  vim.g.loaded_netrwPlugin = 1
  ```
- **Auto-launch file tree** when starting Neovim in a folder:
  ```lua
  if vim.fn.argc() == 1 and vim.fn.isdirectory(vim.fn.argv(0)) == 1 then
    vim.cmd.cd(vim.fn.argv(0))
    require("nvim-tree.api").tree.open()
  end
  ```

---

## Tips

- Run `:Lazy` to manage plugins
- Run `:Mason` to install/manage LSPs
- Use `:map <leader>` to list active leader keymaps
- If key mappings don‚Äôt work, check for null bytes (`^@`) with `nvim -b`

---

Happy hacking in Neovim + Ghostty!
